# Homie: A simple tool for home listings
Contributors: Kaan Ertas, Pujan Patel, Max Pike

## Overview
Over the last half-decade, the market for vacation rentals has largely centralized to a handful of vacation rental websites. The days of having a single listing on one website are largely over, as people list their properties on multiple different websites in the hopes of attracting customers.  The process of uploading the listing of each house on each of the websites can become quite tedious and repetitive.  If you are listing a property, you have to walk through and get a tally of all of the different amenities in the house. You also have to make sure that you donâ€™t miss anything, or else your engagement will fall because of a sparse amenity list.  The natural next step is to find a way to automate this process and make it easier for people to list their property or properties on different vacation rental websites without wasting time manually recounting and uploading the same data over and over again.

Homie is a platform that fulfills this problem. With a few clicks, users can upload all of the pictures within their home, and we will automatically generate a listing of all of the amenities.  If users have multiple properties, they can manage the amenities within each property and easily export the amenities for each one to the popular vacation rental websites.  With Homie, the time spent going through each room in each property is cut exponentially. You only need to take pictures of each room once and upload them to our website, and we will keep track of all of that information for you.
